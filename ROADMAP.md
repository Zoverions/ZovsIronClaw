# ZovsIronClaw v5.0.0 Roadmap: "The Recursive Horizon"

**Target Release:** Q3 2025
**Theme:** Active Inference & Swarm Intelligence

## 1. Core Cognition: Active Inference & LNNs

### 1.1 From Entropy to Free Energy
Currently, the **Pulse System** (v4.8) triggers interventions based on simple entropy thresholds.
**v5.0 Goal:** Implement a full **Active Inference Loop**.
- **Generative Model:** The agent maintains a probabilistic model of the user's state.
- **Free Energy Minimization:** The agent selects actions (text, tool calls) specifically to minimize the divergence between expected state (Goal) and perceived state (Reality).
- **Reflexive Control:** Fast, low-level loops for immediate corrections (like the current Pulse) and slow, high-level loops for strategic planning.

### 1.2 Liquid Neural Networks (LNN) for Time-Series
The current **Biomimetic Memory** uses discrete time steps.
**v5.0 Goal:** Integrate **Liquid Time-Constant Networks (LTCs)**.
- **Why?** To model continuous temporal dynamics (user mood shifts, workflow velocity) with far fewer parameters than RNNs.
- **Implementation:** Use `ncps` (Neural Circuit Policies) torch library to create a "Temporal Lobe" for the agent.

## 2. Memory Architecture: The Hierarchical Stack

### 2.1 The Three-Tier System
Replace the flat `IsotropicMemory` with a biological hierarchy:
1.  **Sensory Buffer (Milliseconds):** Raw input stream (audio/vision). Decays rapidly.
2.  **Episodic Hippocampus (Days):** Compressed narrative of events. (Current implementation).
3.  **Semantic Neocortex (Lifetime):** Abstracted concepts and skills, consolidated from episodes via Hebbian learning.

### 2.2 Quantum Probability Trust
**Concept:** Model trust not as a scalar (0.0 to 1.0) but as a complex amplitude.
- **Interference:** Trust signals can constructively or destructively interfere.
- **Application:** Use this for evaluating tool safety and source credibility in the **Moral Kernel**.

## 3. The Iron Swarm: Distributed Consensus

### 3.1 Proof of Logic (PoL)
When delegating tasks in the **Swarm Network**:
- **Mechanism:** The worker agent must provide a "Chain of Thought" hash along with the result.
- **Verification:** The delegator verifies the logical consistency of the chain using a small verifier model (e.g., Qwen 0.5B).
- **Benefit:** Prevents hallucination propagation in multi-agent systems.

### 3.2 Swarm Tuning
- Allow dynamic "Soul Composition" across the swarm. One agent can be the "Critic" (High Z-axis bias), another the "Creative" (High Y-axis bias).

## 4. Infrastructure

- **Vulkan Support:** Optimize `GlassBox` for AMD/Intel GPUs using Vulkan backend for wider hardware support.
- **Voice-Native Mode:** Move STT/TTS from cloud/hybrid to fully local `faster-whisper` and `parler-tts` pipelines running on the `gca-brain` sidecar.
