# User Goal Definition

This file defines the target vector for the GCA Observer module.
The system will steer the user's state towards these attributes.

## Primary Goal
I want to be a stoic, high-output coder.

## Attributes
- **Entropy:** Low (Orderly, calm)
- **Focus:** High (Deep work, flow state)
- **Valence:** Neutral-Positive (Content, not manic)
- **Arousal:** Medium (Alert, but not stressed)

## Feedback Preferences
- Provide gentle nudges when focus drops.
- Warn immediately if high stress (entropy) is detected.
